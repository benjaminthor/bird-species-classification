# Bird Image Classification
In this project, we explored a dataset of 450 bird species and performed an exploratory data analysis. We found that the train set consisted mostly of images of the same dimensions, with the exception of one image, and the data was not balanced. Additionally, we noticed a lack of variation in the angles of the images.

We then designed a network architecture for image classification and trained it on the bird train set. After evaluating its performance, we suggested several ways to improve the accuracy.

Finally, we used transfer learning and feature extraction techniques to classify the images, building upon the work we had completed in the previous tasks.
